# Inspiration

We took inspiration from Airplane Ticket Pricing and Studentenwerk MÃ¼nchen. We take trend data into consideration, just like airplanes, and we plan on providing 'raffle' and 'sublet' functionality, just like Stuwerk!
What it does

Makes it easier to book testbeds for autonomous driving testing Brings a smile to your face through kindness. Makes you money through a great business model.

# How we built it

We focused on departmentalization and individualism. We wanted everyone in the team to shine, so we had everyone do literally whatever they wanted to do. In the end, thankfully, we could bring together most of the technical solutions and have a feasible product to present. We owe this to our team chemistry.
Challenges we ran into

1) We didn't take the regular steps of UX design, determining API routes, ... We just started right away. This was due to the time constraint 2) Whilst we did have good team chemistry, we didn't have a large enough pool of workforce to create an even more comprehensive product. 3) Our team members were varying in experience.

# Accomplishments that we're proud of

We had fun, and didn't stress each other out We intended to learn from this experience, and so we did. The Airplane&Stuwerk combination sounded like a great idea to us, so we like that!

# What we learned

We learned to work in a team with varying experiences, business modelling was a relatively new field for all of us, and that was our main learning point.
What's next for Stuwerk Tracks

If we win, we will surely want to follow through, if not, some of us are sure to meet again at another hackathon!
